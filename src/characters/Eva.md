# Bio #
A sensitive teen who loves music. Ever since her dad died, her stepmother has been harder on her and pushing her to do more. She's trying to help Eva move on and stay busy but it feels to Eva as though all of a sudden nothing she does is good enough. Eva now is being more distant towards her, she still loves her stepmom but it feels as though Rosario is trying to erase her father's memory. During this time she found her current favorite band whose songs about loss and the pains of growing up really speak to her. Because of them, she has started writing her own music and got the opportunity to start learning the guitar when she reaches the settlement. She is thoughtful and a good listener, but stubborn and struggles to open up to others. She likes daydreaming and caring for children. She hates nosy people and people who put up a front as well as crowds.
