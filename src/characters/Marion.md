# Basics #
Role: Main Antagonist
Inspired by: Yoke The puppets and spiders

# Bio #
A previous owner of "The Mansion" who angered it but taking ownership of one of its treasures without giving it credit. For that he was killed and turned into a puppet with spider features to show his true status as a mere pest. 

# Design Tidbits #
For Marion's puppet form I was heavily inspired by yoke the puppets. I especially thought the tidbit about them being used to criticize royalty hence the transformation being used to mock Marion who used to be wealthy.
