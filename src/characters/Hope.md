# Bio #
The protagonist of a game I have in development. She's a photographer and urban explorer with sticky fingers and a preference for the finer things in life. Whether that's because she likes the feeling of superiority or the style is anyone's guess

# Design Tidbits #
Tried my best to put her in clothes that would be fit for urban exploration sans mask for ease of seeing facial expressions in cutscenes. Her colors were chosen to make you think of money/riches.
