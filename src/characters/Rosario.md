# Bio #
A determined woman who loves being in nature. Even since her husband died, her stepdaughter has become distant and started rebelling, despite her efforts to relate to her. She tries to be optimistic but has been hit with obstacle after obstacle, leading to many of her attempts to cheer others feeling a bit hollow. She is active and good at thinking on her feet, but is anxious and has a tendency to nag. She likes cooking and being in nature as well as classic rock. She hates overly philosophical and flaky people as well as crowds.

# Design Tidbits #
I tried my best to give her an apocalypse friendly outfit since she's outside the bunker dealing with getting supplies and fighting zombies.
