	<h1>Personal</h1>
	<p>I've been spending more time with loved ones lately and that's been super fun! 
		I'm also planning for next year already since I want to start the new year 
		with plans in place. </p>
	<p>I've also picked up a new hobby: browsing sites on the 
		indie web! It's been super fun and at some point I think I'll link out to some
		of my favorites.</p>
	<div class="divider" style="padding-left:4em"></div>
	<h1>Projects and Things I'm Playing With</h1>
	<p>Secret Horror Game - this is a game I'm hoping to make my first Steam release! 
		I'm putting the script in engine and updating my asset list so I can get some 
		art in. This will get a page on the site and more info once I have some art
		to show.</p>
	<p>DS RPG - This is something I've been affectionately calling my fidget toy. I 
		pick this up and play with it every once in a while with long breaks. It's the
		most low level I've ever gotten with code as it is meant to be something that
		would be playable on an actual DS or emulator. This also involves building up
		an engine for it as well.</p>
	<p>Comic Attempt - This is something I'm hoping to get to work on in the new year.
		I want to try making a comic and have for a long time. This is still in the
		VERY early stages: figuring out the overall story and what part/parts I want to
		actually draw out and publish. That said I know my main characters generally but
		they all need designs. Multiple designs each because I am insane haha. 
	</p>
	<p>Dressup Mystery Game - This is a bigger game I've been tossing around in my head
		for a while. It was inspired by the effect what you're wearing can have on how
		people treat you and the question of what would happen if you could use that as
		a special skill to interrogate people. Kinda like Hitman but to help solve a case
		rather than eliminate a target.
