This list is in no particular order at the moment as I'm kinda just listing them off as I think of them

## Art
I've always loved art, but it's taken a long time for me to get somewhat good at it. That used to make me sad, but honestly a big part of my lack of great improvement was because I didn't practice much. Even now I don't draw/create as often as I get the urge to. So the first thing I want to learn is how to draw more. 
I don't want consistency, at least not in the sense of doing the exact same thing in the same way each day. That doesn't seem to work for me as my interest wanes, but what does work is doing the same thing with a small twist. For example, I hydrate with three drinks in the morning when work starts: Golden Citrus green tea, water, and water with Liquid IV. What flavor I drink constantly change due to me picking randomly most days and the order I drink them, how fast or slow I get through them, etc. is up to me. So I'd like something like that to happen with art. Maybe it's not always drawing, maybe it's 3d modeling, or painting, or crochet. No fixed time limit but something that acts as a signal for my brain that it's _mandatory art time_. Joking about that of course, I just mean I want to set that as a minimum.
I want to learn how to draw animals and creatures as well as anthros. I never had an MLP or Warrior Cats or even a dragon phase despite having friends who did as well as being super into fantasy. I don't know how I missed out on this but it very much saddens me. I could've had a ponysona or a Sonic self-insert OC! Plus I think it'd be fun to have nonhuman characters. Games like Beacon Pines (a great game btw) show how you can emphasize character traits more through choosing their animal and it also goes hand in hand with learning how to create more varied faces and bodies in general.
I also want to learn how to draw shoes and masc hair styles. I don't understand how shoes work apparently, despite claiming to love them. It's to the point where I am more likely to approve of a hand I drew in a new position than a drawing of a shoe in a typical "easy" position. Same thing with masc hairstyles. I know how to draw like 2 hairstyles. I kinda just make it up but because I have no idea what I'm doing it looks nonsensical, entertaining in its own right but not great when you're trying to seriously make a character.
## Game Dev
I want to have a good grasp on Unreal. It's not impossible and certain parts have finally started clicking with me, but there's still a long way to go.
Related in part to that, I want to improve my C++ skills and continue on development without a big engine at all. I have this pipe dream of creating a game playable on the DS and have put in some work to that, but there's a long way to go.
## Misc.
I want to put more into learning Japanese. I've been trying to learn the language for years but always gave up at some point, usually due to getting burnt out but I now have access to materials more easily than I did before so maybe I'll be successful this time. Either way, its on the backburner for sure.
## Self Improvement
I want to become better at resting. While I did learn some things, I want to get better at not being forced to rest. Especially now that I've realized I've just been in a cycle of recovering and burning out. Knowing that erases a lot of guilt I have about resting, but it still doesn't come super easily.
