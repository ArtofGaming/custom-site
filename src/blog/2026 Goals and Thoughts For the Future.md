## Game Dev Goals for 2026
This year was a good one for game dev. I managed to release something (although it is not technically a game) which I'm proud of. I've also gotten more of a handle on my personal development process, especially since I tend to work on multiple things at once. 
In 2026, I want to release a game, which at least for the one I have planned to finish first means I have a lot of art to do and some marketing to try doing a proper release with hype posts and a countdown just to see how it works. I've read about it of course, but reading about a thing and doing it are not the same.
I'd like to try my hand at toolmaking as well. I might try the Make Visual Novel Assets Jam for this since I already have an idea. I'm unsure if I want to make a tool for others and not just my personal use and portfolio though. I'm a little nervous about possibly providing support to others for a tool as I've never done it before. Although it might be good practice for a paid release in the future. I'm still undecided.
What I am sure of is that I'd like to do another game jam next year. Whenever I try them I always have a lot of fun although optimally I'll actually finish the one I enter or if I do more than one, have a higher success rate than 0 haha. Maybe I'll even get a team for one attempt since it's been a while since I've devved with others outside of my day job.

## Website Goals for 2026
I'd also like to keep updating this website in the new year as well. I have some small fun pages to add as well as bigger projects to get to: adding graphics to replace any missing ones or placeholders, fleshing out the games page, adding a character/worlds section, and inevitably some other things I come up with during the new year. Remaking this site and actually getting back to tending to it has been really fun. It makes me happy to have a little place on the internet and looking through others' sites has taken up more than a few of my evenings. It's made me feel a bit more connected since there's no pressure to get followers for follwers sake, you're genuinely trying to find others that are interested in your art, or share your fandoms, or just are willing to try out your macaroni and cheese recipe. I've been letting this shape my social media habits a bit and hope I keep channeling that energy in 2026.
